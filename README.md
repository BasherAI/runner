# basher-runner
A runner for Basher. Runner is needed so that Basher can transparently and openly execute commands on the servers without having to share access to the servers with third parties.

## Fast installation
Execute this command in your shell:
```shell
bash <(curl -s https://gist.github.com/sunsetlover36/06e6100e2b38fe421eb9714c74a3e335)
```

Script will install nodejs and yarn. After installation, run `basher-runner` to start the runner.
